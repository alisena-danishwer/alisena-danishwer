# Hi there, I'm Ali Sena Danishwer! 👋

## About Me 🚀

I am a front-end web developer with a strong aspiration to become a software engineer and data scientist. With hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, I am committed to building efficient, scalable, and user-centered digital solutions.

Beyond programming, I have a keen interest in data analysis and machine learning, and I am continuously developing my skills in data science. I also enjoy writing and debating, which have helped me cultivate strong communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities—valuable assets in both technical and collaborative environments.
